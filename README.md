In your browser, create a GitHub project repository with a default README.md. Name the repo as specified above.
Clone your new repository down to your machine into your Documents folder.
Open your new project repository folder in the Documents folder of your machine in VS Code (if you haven't already).
In VS Code, add a useful .gitignore file with a line for .vsode/ and .venv/ and whatever else doesn't need to be tracked in the repository.
In VS Code, edit your README.md to record your commands, process, and notes so far.
In VS Code, open a terminal - PowerShell if Windows, zsh or bash if Mac/Linux.
Use the terminal to git add your files and folders to source control, and git commit your changes with a useful message (e.g. "initial commit"), and git push the changes up to GitHub.
Verify your GitHub repository.
